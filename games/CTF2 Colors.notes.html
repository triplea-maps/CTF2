<b>Overview</b><br>Colors is the basic and simplest CTF2 scenario. All players have the same unit selection and play as fictional colorized combatants instead of real-world countries. Play order starts with Red (Top left) and continues clockwise. Players later in the turn order have more starting PUs as compensation (+50 for each successive player).<br><br>
