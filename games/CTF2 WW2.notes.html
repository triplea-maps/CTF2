<b>Overview</b><br>WW2 is a CTF2 scenario that pits four unique countries against each other. Each country (Russia, Germany, America, and Japan) have the same basic unit selection but have one upgraded unit and one entirely unique unit. For example, the Russian player has Infantry that defend slightly better than those of other countries, and has a unique unit, the Katyusha. Play order starts with Russia (Top left) and continues clockwise. Players later in the turn order have stronger starting units as compensation (+50 Total Unit Value for each successive player).<br><br>
